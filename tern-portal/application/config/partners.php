AusCover is also developing a consolidated repository and meta-database, including standard processing and validation methods for specific biophysical land cover products and basic processed time-series biophysical image maps. This will involve processing of medium resolution satellite data from national archives, as well as data from current and future satellite acquisition, supported by a national system of instrumented field validation sites.</p>"
