    <h1 class="margin10">Submit Data</h1>
    <p>One of the aims of TERN is to collectively increase the research capacity of the Australian ecosystem science community by collecting, storing, sharing and enabling integration of data across different disciplines. Information regarding the contribution of data and expertise is provided below for each TERN Facility.</p>
    <h2><a name="Auscover"></a>AusCover</h2>
    <p>The AusCover partners include all of the major satellite remote sensing data groups in the Commonwealth Government, State Governments and Australian research organisations. . AusCover maintains strong collaborative links with international organisations and activities through their partners. To submit data please contact your relevant <a href="http://data.auscover.org.au/?q=node/24" target="_blank" class="external">state AusCover partner</a> or email <a href="mailto:data%40auscover.org.au">Matt Paget</a> for any data related enquires.</p>   
    <h2><a name="Coasts"></a>Australian Coastal Ecosystem</h2>
    <p>The Australian Coastal Ecosystems Facility (ACEF) collects and distributes key coastal datasets – concerning flora, fauna, and biophysical properties - for use in policy and management decisions about the protection and use of Australia’s marine, estuarine and freshwater coastal assets. In particular, ACEF is interested in collecting, harvesting and publishing water quality, coastal habitats (eg. seagrass, mangroves, corals), marine turtles and beach morphology datasets across Australia. 
Please contact <a href="mailto:jonathan.hodge%40csiro.au">Jonathan Hodge</a> to discuss data submission related to the above topics.
</p>
     <h2><a name="ACEAS"></a>Australian Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis</h2>
     <p>The Australian Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (ACEAS) provides an opportunity for scientists, policy makers and data managers to work in groups to produce synthesis products, specifically to link science to management activities. These groups are funded through open calls for proposals and selected based on a competitive process. ACEAS does not manage any datasets, except the synthesis data product outcomes of the working groups. Please contact <a href="mailto:aceas.tern%40uq.edu.au">Alison Specht</a> for information on working group activities. </p>
      <h2><a name="Ozflux"></a>OzFlux</h2>      
     <p>The data collected and curated by the TERN-OzFlux Facility falls into two broad classes.  The primary data consists of time series of meteorological observations (temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, solar and terrestrial radiation etc) and the corresponding exchanges of momentum, heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide between the surface and the lowest layer of the atmosphere.  These data are collected at a <a href="http://www.ozflux.org.au/monitoringsites/index.html" target="_blank" class="external">number of sites around Australia</a>.
     </p>
     <p>
         The second category is ancillary data collected to support the analysis and interpretation of the time series data.  This consists of allometric and leaf-level photosynthetic data at seasonal time scales for selected sites and remotely sensed data for each site such as leaf-area index and albedo.  Primary data from 23 sites are currently available from the <a href="http://ozflux.its.monash.edu.au/ecosystem/home" target="_blank" class="external">OzFlux Data Portal</a>.
     </p>
     <p>
         Researchers submitting their data to the OzFlux Data Portal can also choose to have their data collections registered with ANDS <a href="http://researchdata.ands.org.au/" target="_blank" class="external">Research Data Australia</a>.  People wishing to join the TERN-OzFlux community and submit data to the OzFlux Data Portal can do so by registering for an account on the OzFlux Data Portal home page or by contacting <a href="mailto:pisaac.ozflux%40gmail.com">Peter Isaac</a> or <a href="mailto:eva.vangorsel%40csiro.au">Eva van Gorsel</a>.
     </p>
     <h2><a name="Soils"></a>Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia</h2>
     <p>The TERN Soils and Landscape Facility is developing fine resolution national grids of key soil attributes through the application of digital soil mapping techniques. This utilises available soil site and mapped soil data as inputs to attribute estimation models, as well as comparing modelled outputs to site data for validation. Submission of soil site and mapped data is to be arranged through state government agencies in cooperation with the Australian Collaborative Land Evaluation Program, which delivers and manages the Australian Soil Resource Information System (ASRIS). Please contact <a href="mailto:peter.wilson%40csiro.au">Peter Wilson</a> for further information.</p>
     <h2><a name="MSPN"></a>Multi-Scale Plot Network</h2>
    <p>The Multi-Scale Plot Network (MSPN) collects a range of ecological plot data covering rangelands, forests, long-term ecological monitoring programs and sub-continental transects that span from coasts to inland. These data come from a range of sub-Facilities, including Supersites. Researchers will use the SHaRED tool, under development by Eco-informatics to submit ecological plot-based datasets to the Australian Ecological Knowledge and Observation System (<a href="http://www.aekos.org.au/" target="_blank" class="external">ÆKOS</a>). Please contact <a href="mailto:kathryn.allard%40anu.edu.au">Kathryn Allard</a> for data related enquires with MSPN.</p> 
     <h2><a name="ASN"></a>Australian Supersites Network</h2>
    <p>The Australian Supersite Network data repository manages data from a number of supersites across the country. Each Supersite represents a different ecosystem type and takes long-term vegetative, faunal and biophysical measurements in a series of core experiments. Core experiment measurements cover meteorology and fluxes, faunal monitoring, soils and hydrology, vegetation, landscape and water measurements. Data from each site must be collected, formatted and indexed to create a dataset and stored in CSV, text and Excel file formats along with descriptive metadata. 
Submitting a dataset to the ASN repository is done using the Morpho desktop application. Instructions for downloading Morpho and using it for formatting data and creating datasets are available in <a href="http://www.tern-supersites.net.au/index.php/data/repository-tutorial" target="_blank" class="external">http://www.tern-supersites.net.au/index.php/data/repository-tutorial</a>.
To request a username and password for secure uploading, contact <a href="mailto:info@tern-supersites.net.au">Siobhann McCafferty</a>.</p>

  <h2><a name="Eco-informatics"></a>Eco-informatics</h2>
    <p>Rich ecological data on plants, animals and their environments are submitted for storage in <a href="http://www.aekos.org.au/" target="_blank" class="external">ÆKOS</a> (Australian Ecological Knowledge and Observation System) using two methods. Datasets contributed by government agencies are submitted directly to the Eco-informatics Facility Data Analysts who model the data, add significant contextual details and fully integrate each into ÆKOS so that the full richness of the information can be re-used. 
Researcher datasets, initially from the Multi-Scale Plot Network (MSPN), are generally submitted via the <a href="http://www.aekos.org.au/about_submission" target="_blank" class="external">SHaRED</a> (Submission, Harmonisation and Retrieval of Ecological Data) tool, although those we consider especially significant long-term MSPN datasets may be fully integrated into ÆKOS by Data Analysts. The SHaRED tool will be available in late 2013. Please contact <a href="mailto:enquiry%40aekos.org.au">David Turner</a> to further discuss about data submission to <a href="http://www.aekos.org.au/" target="_blank" class="external">ÆKOS</a>.

</p>

<h2><a name="EMAST"></a>Ecosystem Modelling and Scaling Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>The Ecosystem Modelling and Scaling Infrastructure (e-MAST) uses a wide variety of data from across TERN Facilities to provide tools to systematically test and improve ecosystem models.  For example, e-MAST is generating a comprehensive set of elevation sensitive interpolated climate data at monthly and daily time steps. These data will be used to support the model-data assimilation scheme and ecosystem model assessments being conducted by e-MAST including statistical climate downscaling. 
Please contact <a href="mailto:michael.hutchinson%40anu.edu.au">Michael Hutchinson</a> for more information on data contribution.
