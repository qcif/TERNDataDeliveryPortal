<div class="content">The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was designed to meet the needs of the science community for frequent, high quality observations of global atmospheric, oceanic and ecological systems metrics and information. Much effort has been directed at validation and comparison of MODIS based ecological variables. Significant and complex issues remain in the use of the data over the Australian land surface, particularly over the Australian bright arid and semi-arid regional environments. These challenges include the accurate atmospheric correction of MODIS visible observations. Any limitations in the quality of atmospheric correction of MODIS data have implications for all products derived from visible observations. Recognizing this, TERN/AusCover developed an atmospheric correction algorithm for Australian MODIS land-surface observations that meets several specific needs:<br />
- incorporates best available ancillary data sources<br />
- can be applied to current and historical MODIS observations<br />
- can be efficiently implemented on computing facilities available to AusCover<br />
- and is easily extendible to provide VIIRS (or other instrument) atmospheric correction.<br /><br />
The Simple Method for Atmospheric Correction (SMAC) meets these requirements and forms the basis of the AusCover SMAC for MODIS (ASM).These data should be cited as  made available by  through TERN/AusCover and accessed on</div>

Photopoints were also placed away from shore in other land forms (sand sheets, plains). Some sites were revisited during the Muloorina Assessment of 1999 and another photopoint placed. All sites would form the basis of general vegetation community monitoring to evaluate trends in structure and composition.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">The study was conducted in 25 fragments of native vegetation in the Southern Mt Lofty Ranges. It assessed the use of nested subset analysis as a conservation tool. This will allow establishment of gradient in proneness to extinction (predictable extinction sequence). This in turn allows to identify species sensitive to habitat fragmentation and therefore extinction. It would then be easier to prioritise conservation management actions. Furthermore, vested subset analysis can be used to suggest what factors might be contributing to the composition patterns within a community.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">Mallee vegetation covered 383,000 square kilometres of Australia but 35% of that has been cleared (Federal Dpt Environment and Heritage, http://audit.ea.gov.au/anra/vegetation). Remnant mallee occurs as isolated fragments throughout Australia's wheat and sheep producing lands, and harbours important biodiversity. However, altered fire regimes are potentially a serious threat to the survival of species in isolated mallee remnants. Single large fires could burn out entire remnants, eliminating fire sensitive species, or complete fire suppression could eliminate early successional species. Because remnants are isolated, there would be no opportunity for recolonisation resulting in widespread species declines. Our broad aim is to develop solutions to the problems posed by altered fire regimes in remnant vegetation. We plan to conduct a large-scale replicated experiment examining the response of plant and animal species to fire and fire frequency, and to examine the role of refuges in the recovery of populations after fire. The mechanism of recolonisation after fire is poorly understood, but knowledge of the mechanism is critical for the development of fire regimes that will conserve biodiversity in production landscapes. We will focus on remnant mallee ecosystems on the Eyre Peninsula, South Australia. Observations were conducted at Hincks, Hambridge, Munyaroo, Heggaton and Pinkawillinie Conservation Park from 2004-2006.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

The first sampling was done in 2000 and annual sampling was conducted until 2003, with the possibility of further sampling in five and ten years. Initial monitoring has shown that there is some localised detrimental effects at Hansen, otherwise no dramatic effects are evident - see reports for further details. Annual surveys are conducted using two techniques: (1) Transects of 500m length. Every ten metres, the density and health of Melaleuca halmaturorum and Melaleuca brevifolia was recorded for a 2 metre width each side of the transect. (2) Step point data - a set area is stepped out and whatever is stepped on is recorded - this technique records all species.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">This program was conducted in Oct 1999 and monitored the nationally threatened plant species Cullen parvum and Dodanaea procumbens in Mokota Conservation Park. The projects aims were to: - Determine if the removal of stock grazing results in increased recruitment and survival of Cullen parvum and Dodanaea procumbens plants.  - Determine if the removal of stock grazing results in increased weed invasion in the vicinity of Cullen parvum and Dodanaea procumbens populations in the park.  - Determine if the removal of stock grazing results in increased competition from other native species. - Determine if park management - in particular weed, feral animal, and fire management - is adequate and appropriate for the management of these species.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

It aims to determine different plant responses to disturbance, predominantly fire, but not exclusively. This information will then be used to develop appropriate fire regimes. Data is collected in relation to both natural fires and prescribed burns. For prescribed burns the plants are often tagged prior to the burn to allow identification following the fire. Alternatively areas with known fire histories are studied, and plant characteristics and regrowth noted. Note that data collection is opportunistic for wildfires and prescribed burns, however there is a methodology followed, outlined in a hand book that includes field attributes.  Data collected includes:  - regeneration of plants.  - response and regeneration of soil seed blown in.  - time taken to develop mature seed.  - life expectancy.  - voucher specimens if necessary for identification.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

If the burn area is greater than 1 ha then a number of monitoring sites within the burn are made. The vegetation is surveyed before the burn, immediately after, one year after and then every 3 years after that. The sampling includes setting up photopoints, doing a Ramble survey of plant species, and fixed quadrats and transects. Photopoints are at the same sites as the quadrat sites. Monoitoring will measure fuel hazard, environmental risks, vegetation floristics/ structure and key habitat factors. During the burn information is recorded on the weather, and post fire the survey is repeated. Each prescribed burn has a pre and post assessment and is entered in to the Fire database. The frequency of the burn depends on weather, previous year and other factors. The rates of regeneration can be monitored and  the response of biota to fire and drought.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">This project aims to establish if Southern Brown Bandicoots survived after the February 2000 fire in Wandillo Fire Reserve.  David Paull's walking transect methodology (diggings) is used to assess bandicoot population abundance.  This involves walking an established loop of 100-150 metres and counting the diggings and allocating an age class (fresh, recent, old) to the digging.  Approximately 12 sites (transects) were assessed in areas that were known to be good historic bandicoot habitats.  The first survey was conducted in Mid-2000 and it is hoped that the area can be revisited every 6-12 months, at any time of year.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">BHP Billiton requires a fauna survey and potential impact study assessment of the proposed infrastructure corridor between Whyalla and Olympic Dam. Two teams from Ecological Associates Pty Ltd will survey fauna at two sites along the corridor. These sites are approx. 20km north of Whyalla and approx. 50km north of Port Augusta. They have been chosen in consultation with DEH to address shortfalls in fauna surveys along the corridor. At each site 5 traplines will be established, each within an identified vegetation association. Sites will be surveyed between 9 September 2007 and 14 September 2007. At each site 1 Elliot trapline (15 traps), 1 pitfall trapline (6 pits) and 2 cage traps will be established and maintained for 4 nights. 2 sites selected each with 5 sets of traps as described. The aim is to identify terrestrial fauna potentially inhabiting the infrastructure corridor.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">Surveys of bushbirds have been conducted in key vegetation communities on Flinders Ranges National Park as a potential indicator of improvements in vegetation condition following control of total grazing pressure through the bounceback program. The surveys aim to develop techniques for evaluation of bushbirds as indicators of ecological recovery in response to improved habitat and food resources after integrated control of rabbits, goats and foxes. 21 sites have been established in 7 different vegetation types across Flinders Ranges National Park. Bushbirds are monitored using line transect methodology with species and numbers of birds sighted in 100 metre blocks recorded on each transect. Vegetation transects have also been established at each site however the data is included in a separate database.  Monitored mostly quarterly (started from March 2000).

Locations on Eyre Peninsula and in the Southeast of SA where these ecological communities could occur were assessed to establish whether vegetation was likely to meet the published criteria for the listed communities. The results of the survey were incorporated into updated spatial data on  1. the broad regional boundaries where the listed communities may occur and  2. vegetation polygons that may meet the condition and composition criteria for the listed communities. These layers are available in SDE and have been supplied to the Australian government, which funded the project.

<div class="content">Brush-tailed Bettongs were released into Lincoln National Park on five occasions. A total of 113 bettongs were released into Lincoln National Park over 5 translocation events between September 1999 and April 2001. Monitoring of Brush-tailed Bettongs is conducted twice once a year in the months of April and September. The aim is to confirm presence, monitor distribution and detect any newly recruited individuals. Five transects (Memory Cove 1&amp; 2, Entrance, Taylor's Landing and Donnington) throughout the park are trapped over five nights. Each transect is 4km in length and has a trap every 100m. Trapping results so far from 2005 (July and November) detected three individuals along only the Donnington transect. This is similar to past trapping results (DEH 2002, Martin et al. 2004). One tagged female (638) with pouch young and two new adult males were captured.  Both were weighed and measured and the new males were ear-tagged (218 &amp; 209). Data suggests that the Brush-tailed Bettong population is persisting at low densities.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">New arrivals of pests not yet present on Kangaroo Island have the potential to devastate natural ecosystems and primary production. The risk of an accidental or deliberate introduction of damaging pests and diseases is real and the consequences highly significant. Legislation, policy and procedures to protect the island's biodiversity and natural resource-based industries from new species introductions (whether accidental or planned) are poorly developed and fragmented. There is currently no biosecurity strategy containing border detection systems to prevent and manage unwanted introduced species on Kangaroo Island. The objectives of a Biosecurity Strategy are to: - Prevent invaders (pest animals, weeds and diseases) from entering Kangaroo Island through the development of a tight quarantine policy; - Develop early detection systems that allow for rapid responses and eradication of any incursions if high-risk invaders do arrive; and - Provide a strategic framework upon which to assess risk and then manage existing pests that threaten biosecurity.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">Grazing, the planting of introduced species and more recently the alteration of water regime to sustain agricultural practices has drastically altered the pre-european landscape of Upper 4th Creek. Much of the upper storey of the area remains intact with the Candlebark (Eucalyptus dalrympleana) association in the eastern area being a feature of noted conservation significance. West of this association the creekline and riparian area is dominated by Pink Gum (Eucalyptus fasciculosa) which merges with Stringybark (Eucalypyus obliqua) at higher altitudes on south facing slopes. The understorey today contains a great variety of introduced species which continue to threaten remnant native vegetation. Due to the common occurrence of this process across catchments within the Mount Lofty Ranges, many native species confined to catchment areas are now listed as having rated conservation significance. NPWSA is committed to the rehabilitation of land within reserve boundaries with catchment areas being areas of high priority. The Upper Fourth Creek Action Plan outlines activities undertaken in the course of rehabilitation.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">A trapping program was established in 1997 to monitor the impact of RHD on small vertebrate populations. Surveys have continued under the Bounceback program and aim to develop techniques for evaluation of ecological recovery of small vertebrates in response to improved habitat and food resources after integrated control of rabbits, goats and foxes. Eight sites have been established (four on Flinders Ranges National Park and adjacent Gum Creek Station and four on Gammon Ranges National Park and adjacent Wertaloona Station) to monitor the impact of rabbit control, fox baiting and pastoralism on small vertebrates. Permanent pitfall traps were placed in a circular trapping web formation with 12 radial arms and 10 pits per arm spaced at 10 metre intervals. Trapping data includes the number of captures/recaptures, species, sex, age class and reproductive condition.

To alleviate environmental damage and prioritise management activities for the Road Reserve. Many of the road reserves are two and three chains wide and contain significant stands of native vegetation, predominately Mallee associations. This project focuses on two and three chain roads and other roads idenified as a priority based on knowledge of the location of rated plant species and proximity to priority vegetation associations. About 800 km of roadside vegetation was surveyed in 2003/2004, using the Drive-by Survey Methodology. The condition of the vegetation and the vegetation associations were documented and mapped to identify potential revegetation sites and significant sites. The location of significant sites will be used to determine the requirements for and positioning of roadside markers as part of a Roadside Marker Sceme (RMS), which will be implemented subject to future funding.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

This provides information on range expansion across the island and persistence at monitored sites. The island was last surveyed in April 2005 and increased activity on the southern end of the island was noticeable, with high levels of foraging activity in areas where sour-sob bulbs were present. Dry conditions increased visibility of tracks at burrows and probably accounts for the decrease in number of 'possibly used' burrows. Of interest was the increase in the number of old and collapsed burrows observed during the field trip (Jason van Weenen, pers. com.).Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">The Para Wirra Vegetation Recovery Program concerns the improvement of degraded park areas within the South Para Block by managing kangaroo populations. Grazing impacts were identified as a serious environmental issue for Para Wirra in the mid 1980's.  Early studies estimated kangaroo population at 35-45 roos/sq km and showed that 5 roos/sq km was required to permit regeneration of palatable plant species. When rabbit grazing impact was determined as insignificant in the late 1990's (post calici-virus), a kangaroo culling program was established.

<div class="content">The European red fox (Vulpes vulpes), an elusive introduced species is prevalent in the Morialta and Black Hill Conservation Parks area.  Predation by the fox is a major contributing factor to the decline of some native species of bird, reptile, and small mammals. Of particular concern in the Morialta Conservation Park is the decline of the southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus) population of which fox predation is a known threat. Baiting stations have been established along walking trails and are laid by parks staff and teams of volunteers over a 6 week period for the years 1999/2000/2001. Bait uptake and fox signs are recorded which indicate there are significant numbers present.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="label"></div>

</div>

<div class="content">Via threatened flora population monitoring, this project aims to reduce immediate threats to threatened flora species, and understand their ecology to better manage them. Management Plans can be created or adapted to reflect new information, and sites that need more detailed monitoring can be identified and efforts can be focussed where needed the most.  This may include protection and restoration or revegetation. It is preferable that the populations can be sustained with minimal tampering. Where revegetation does occur, these plants are not included in future population counts.  Data is collected (began in 2003) from known populations in the South East (usually annual recounts in Spring) or when new populations are discovered. The populations are spatially recorded as individuals or as a group, especially where there is a high density of plants - the method is generally to plot the plants from a centrepoint. Other attributes may also be assessed such as plant size and health, grazing pressure, recruitment, total counts, proportion of seedlings.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">The Bandicoot Monitoring Program is a community-based survey managed by the Sturt Upper Reaches Landcare Group (SURLG). The DEH Bandicoot Recovery Prgram for the Mt Lofty Ranges works closely with SURLG to provide technical advice and equipment. The overarching goal of the SURLG Bandicoot Monitoring Program is to improve the distribution of southern brown bandicoots in the local area by raising public awareness of the conservation needs of the species. The program aims to: maintain a longitudinal study of the presence and distribution of small ground-dwelling mammals, including southern brown bandicoot on private properties in the Sturt catchment;support and increase the involvement of local landholders in biodiversity conservation and habitat restoration, and to strengthen native vegetation linkages where possible; assess the effect of landholder habitat restoration strategies on the presence and distribution of southern brown bandicoots on individual properties.  This is achieved using an annual hairtubing and vegetation monitoring program which is conducted by landholders with guidance from members of the SURLG. Survey started in 2003.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

Assessments were conducted in 1997 and 1999 on the Flinders Ranges National Park and reported on trends which compared disturbance levels to neighbouring pastoral leases sharing similar vegetation attributes. The Gammon Ranges was assessed during 1999 by private consultant and together with the Flinders Ranges National Park and was re assessed during September 2002 to provide some trend analysis for both parks. Detailed transect notes/GPS locality and slide photographs are taken at each site for verification of ratings.

Project was carried out over Arid and Semi-Arid Range country including Flinders, Olary and Gawlers. With a need to describe the habitats/communities where feral goat impacts were being measured, a vegetation survey was added to the ecological monitoring component. Again funding and time restrictions, meant only small parts of the controlled areas could be evaluated and emphasis was placed on the elevated, semi-arid, rocky ranges for various reasons.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">The Pick Swamp property, abutting the western edge of Piccaninnie Ponds Conservation Park was purchased by DEH in 2005 to help restore a reprasentative Karst discharge site and wetland system. Pick Swamp has been a grazing property for approximately 45 years. To support grazing the property was cleared, drained and improved with exotic pasture grasses, clovers and fertilizers. The restoration project will allow surface water coverage similar to pre-European times and the deliberate and natural return to indigenous vegetation associations. During this time it is expected that a transitional change will occur in the bird populations of the property. A report titled "Piccaninnie Ponds, Piccaninnie Swamp and Picks Swamp Vegetation Monitoring Framework" by Jason Nicol, Ben Taylor and Steve Clarke (copy on Corporate data Storage Area) outlines the moitoring program. Survey conducted between 2007-2012.  Main datasets collected as part of the ongoing monitoring include Birds (monthly - 4 transects), Vegetation (periodically -before inundation and post), and photopoints.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="label"></div>

</div>

<div class="content">The Wetland Inventory of Eyre Peninsula documents a representative sample of inland wetlands by recording their physical, chemical and biological attributes. Twenty-seven wetlands were surveyed (in September 2000), the majority of these comprised saline lake systems and brackish water bodies, with only 1 freshwater wetland being recorded during the survey.  The aquatic invertebrate fauna was notably scarce in many of the wetlands surveyed. This may be attributed to the high conductivity readings in the majority of wetlands, only 4 wetlands displayed good invertebrate diversity. The correlation between increasing salinity levels and decreasing biological activity was clear, and this decline is of concern for the health of many wetlands.  Several wetlands surveyed are considered to be nationally important as they meet the ANZECC criteria of being a good example of a wetland type occurring within a biogeographic region in Australia. These wetlands include the saline lake systems within Lincoln National Park and Lake Newland Conservation Park. Seven wetlands are recommended for monitoring, and include four wetlands in the District Council of Elliston and three wetlands managed by the Department for Environment and Heritage.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">In the spring of 2007 the Nature Conservation Society of South Australia undertook a survey of native vegetation in cemeteries in the South East of South Australia. Many of the areas of remnant native vegetation surveyed exist in a cleared and highly modified landscape making these comparatively small remnants the last link with the South East's pre European vegetation. Comprehensive biological surveys, opportunistic records and bird surveys were undertaken in the the local government areas of Tatiara, Naracoorte Lucindale, Wattle Range, Robe, Grant and the City of Mount Gambier.  The aim of the Survey was to assess the floristic and avian biodiversity assets of cemeteries in the South East of South Australia. The Survey findings will be used to provide local councils with recommendations to conserve important native vegetation remnants and to inform councils of their obligations under the Native Vegetation Act 1991 and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The project has undertaken biological surveys following standard DEH protocols for flora for 15 cemetery sites across the South East. Opportunistic floristic data was collected for a further 20 sites. Field collections were between September and December 2007.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="label"></div>

</div>

<div class="content">This project aims to establish a monitoring program for freshwater soaks in the southern lagoon of the Coorong National Park. The freshwater soaks were mapped, a long term monitoring program was established and flora and fauna data were collected to inform management actions for release of drainage waters in to the Coorong and wetland pondage in Tilley Swamp Watercourse and Morella Basin. The fieldwork was completed from 10 to 13 July, 2001 and freshwater soaks were identified by testing the conductivity of the water with a conductivity meter. Not all sites had standing freshwater so holes were dug and water temperature was also taken. Four sites were permanently marked with steel droppers and vegetation photopoint tags, a GPS marked the steel droppers and photos were taken of the site and mud maps drawn. A plant list was recorded for each site suitable for future monitoring. Identified bird species in a 500 m radius of each soak and the presence of other vertebrate fauna was recorded (scats, tracks, digging and grazing). This report is a summary of monitoring on 5 fresh water soaks in the southern part of Coorong National Park, this is a continuous long term project. It includes July 2002 and late summer 2003 monitoring. The survey sites were established to monitor changes in water salinity levels in a number of fresh water soaks over time and to monitor any changes to composition and health of the vegetation growing in association with these soaks in response to changes to water regimes in the Tilley Swamp watercourse and Morella basin.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

This project is associated with the "Plant Fire Response Monitoring" project, and the same burn may be used to collect data for both projects. There is no particulatar regime for the project - when there is a burn planned, a site is created. This is usually on reserve, however may sometimes be off reserve.   Prior to the burn a standard "Fuel Hazard Assessment Data Sheet" is used to record the attributes for each site. This includes   - the dominant species for a site, including the 3 dominant trees and the understorey, (a full plant list is not taken).  - site location details and GPS location.  - year of last known fire.  - litter bed depth, surface fine fuel, elevated fuel hazard, bark hazard. During and following the fire, the Fuel Hazard is determined via the methods outlined in the Fuel Hazard Guide Handbook.  This includes the rates of regrowth for different vegetation types. In addition to data collected for intended burns, information is also recorded following accidental fires, or areas with a fire history.

<div class="label"></div>

</div>

<div class="content">The swamp antechinus is a small marsupial, which on mainland Australia only occurs in small fragmented populations around the SE coast in low lying thickly vegetated swampy areas. Past and present human impacts on this type of habitat are causing grave concerns for the future of the species in SA and it is questionable whether the reserve system in this state adequately conserves areas of potential habitat for the swamp antechinus. The present lack of understanding of the exact habitat requirements of the swamp antechinus in SA is the driving force behind this study.  The project is aiming to discover and describe the exact habitat requirements of the swamp antechinus in the western limits of its range, (just south of Robe in SA). The focal point of this study is a recently discovered (1997) population on privately owned land on the NE corner of Lake St. Clair. The hope is that this population can be located again through capturing live individuals and the core habitat requirements of the species documented. This information can then be used across the SE to gain a better understanding of what is required for conservation of the species in this state, including adequate protection within the reserve system. The project was conducted between 2000-2005.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">As part of a re-introduction program of Brush Tailed Bettongs into South Australia, captive bred animals were released on six offshore Islands including St Francis Island, Baird Bay Island, Wedge Island, St Peters Island and Venus Bay Island A. In the case of the latter, small numbers of bettongs were trialed and later released onto the Venus Bay peninsula were extensive eradication and control programs of rabbit, fox and cats were undertaken within a fenced  part of the mainland. To facilitate trapping of animals on Island A, a grid was used to systematically record population dynamics and home ranges. The success of this stage of the reintroduction supported multiple releases of both captive bred and  hardened individuals from Island A Venus Bay Conservation Park on to St Francis Island which now is free of feral animals. Animals were also transferred from Island A to Baird Bay Island Conservation Park to reduce pressure on the densely populated Venus Bay populations. Trapping grids were employed for data collection on other islands. Other captive bred animals from various sources were also released and monitored on Wedge Island and St Peters island where competition and predators are absent or nearly so. Yookamurra Sanctuary also contains an undisclosed number of bettongs released from Warrawong Sanctuary, monitoring was undertaken between 1993 - 1996.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

</div>

<div class="content">Monitoring presence and extent of species in relation to topography and post fire monitoring. Sedgeland areas within Messent Conservation Park are known to support populations of the threatened plant species Senecio macrocarpus and Thelymitra epipactoides. The possibility of reinstating surface freshwater flows into Messent Conservation Park lead to a botanical survey of these areas in 2001, in order to contribute to the knowledge of the distribution of these species, particularly in the area that may be potentially flooded (Cutten &amp; Squire, 2002). In May 2002, (after the initial survey), a NPWSA prescribed burn accidentally got away and burnt a large area of the park (3,148 ha), including approximately 50% of the sedgeland within the area of interest and the site of the 1977 record of Thelymitra epipactoides, (Cutten &amp; Squire, 2002). Cutten &amp; Squire, (2002) recommended that monitoring occur as soon as posible, so as to give the greatest chance of finding Thelymitra epipactoides within the Alf Flat area, and to determine the effects of fire on Senecio macrocarpus. Subsequently, in order to investigate the impacts of the May 2002 prescribed burn on Senecio macrocarpus and Thelymitra epipactoides populations, transects that were entirely or partially burnt during the May 2002 fire were re-surveyed in October 2002 (approximately 6 months after the fire).  Methods used were the same as those used in 2001 - GPS and data loggers to record locations along transect lines. Aditionally the only previously known location of Thelymitra epipactoides was searched, as it too had been burnt during the 2002 fire.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="label"></div>

</div>

<div class="content">This project involved collection of data (2001-2006) on small fauna species (&amp; wombats) usage of the steep constructed drain crossing (Martins Washpool), two years after construction.   Objectives: (1) To establish a methodology for future monitoring of usage of fauna crossings over the Tilley Swamp Drain. (2) To collect baseline information on fauna usage of crossings a year after their construction. It is apparent that larger faunal species (ie. wombat, kangaroo, emu, swamp hen, fox and deer) are utilising drain crossings, and house mice. What is less clear from this initial work is whether species moving between other habitat types, though M. halmatuorum tall shrubland (such as small skinks found at Transect 2), would successfully negotiate the drain crossing. This is an important concept given that species recolonisation of isolated habitats after events such as fire, may be prevented if the drain crossings do not facilitate such movement. The two critical elements in evaluating this will be continued monitoring over an extended time, and review of the season in which monitoring takes place to maximise chances of detecting species radiation on crossings. Visual assessment of the regeneration of vegetation on the crossing should continue via annual photopoint survey. Use of the crossing may be restricted until an adequate amount of vegetative cover has established. The monitoring should be continued annually to assess the ongoing impact of the drain on small faunal movement in the vicinity of the Tilley Swamp Drain.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">Friends of Riverland Parks conducted spotlighting surveys (began in 2002) to determine the status of the Common Brushtail Possum in the Lock 4 section of the Katarapko National Park and Calperum Station in the Riverland. The first 5 surveys revealed a population density in the area surveyed equivalent to that which other surveys in other parts of Australia have recorded.  In order to establish what animals are present in other parts of the Katarapko National Park, the Friends of Riverland parks have commenced a series of surveys. The Lock 4 section of the park was selected for the first of the possum surveys, to not only record the presence of this marsupial, but also to compare the numbers from two locations in that part of the park.  Glossop High School has a structure on the inlet creek that enables a backwater in the area to be periodically flooded and dried out to resemble the original regime in the backwater. Nearby is the main channel of the River Murray that is now a permanent wetland. Transects have been established adjacent to each of these wetlands to record Brushtail Possums. These counts will also form the basis for monitoring both areas for any differences due to the nature of the adjacent wetland.  Monitoring any changes that may result from the different stages of the wetting and drying cycles will also be of interest.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">Assessment of land use options for the Tallaringa Block was made in 1988. It included photopoint installation for land system mapping and to monitor grazing impact. Biological survey was also undertaken in 1988 and again in 1993. A few photopoints were established in the early stage of rangeland monitoring in South Australia. Photopoints were placed in many of the Park's plant communities, which have collectively enabled the monitoring of these plant communities to evaluate trends in structure and composition as well as fire impacts. The survey's objective was to carry out a vegetation survey as part of an assessment of the conservation value versus potential pastoral value of this large block of Crown Land.

<div class="content">Flooded areas were sampled as part of a second complete census of the Chowilla Bush Stone-curlew population. Sampling was conducted over the known extent of occurrence on the floodplain of the Chowilla and Ral Ral anabranches. The census used call playback methods to systematically cover this extent from west to east over 12 nights. Geographical sectors were used to manage identification of selected play sites (i.e. from where the call recording was played).  Call playback was used to acquire a rough locational fix on individual birds. As a cryptic and nocturnal species, the Bush Stone-curlew is most frequently located by aural means. This can often be assisted by playing a recording of the call to encourage vocal responses from the birds. Call playback is a well-documented means of sampling elusive species, and has been widely used as a survey method in other Bush Stone-curlew studies (Price 2004, Gates 2001).  The call playback procedure comprised a five-minute stop at each play site. The recording was played for 30 seconds, observers listened for two minutes, and the sequence once repeated. Recorded calls were projected through two speakers attached to the roof of a vehicle. The direction of any bird calls responding to the recording (`vocal responses?) was estimated with a compass, and distance to the responding bird was approximated.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

These include surveys to improve knowledge of the distribution and habitat requirements of this small bird. A recommendation from a recent assessment of its distribution, habitat and conservation status (Pickett 2007) was that additional targeted surveys of historical and potential locations should be undertaken, and that these ought be conducted in spring when the species is generally more vocal and thus more detectable. Accordingly, DEH contracted the author to undertake further survey work during 2007. The aims were to: - Undertake targeted surveys at 15-25 sites (depending on extent and location) during the species? 2007 breeding season. - Collect habitat description data at each new confirmed location. - Provide a brief report summarising findings and including a map of survey sites, but excluding analysis of habitat data (to be conducted separately at a later date). - Provide an updated database of records for the MLR CRHW.

<div class="content">The major focus of this project is to identify groundwater biodiversity hot spots in SA, and to link these areas of high diversity to their geological and climatological history. The geology and climatological history of areas can give important clues about the timing and the circumstances that surface freshwater (and sometimes also marine) groups invaded the groundwater environment. Because dispersal in groundwater is very limited, obligate groundwater fauna is usually spatially restricted and can therefore be used as important indicator species of water quality parameters. Localities that potentially contain groundwater fauna are in areas with fractured rocks, karstified limestones, or coarse alluvial depositions. However, the presence or absence of groundwater fauna in such areas will depend on whether surface fauna would have had the chance to colonise the groundwater environment some time in the geological history. For sampling groundwater we are restricted to use existing 'windows' to the groundwater environment, which are: wells, bores, springs, caves and creek beds with very shallow water table.  Initial sampling efforts will concentrate on localising presence of groundwater fauna in the following main areas Southern Flinders Ranges, Mount Lofty Ranges, Limestone Coast of the South East and Eyre Peninsula.     Preliminary collecting in the Gammon and Flinders Ranges in October 02 revealed significant biodiversity in ground water samples from springs and creek beds. All invertebrate groups that are to be expected in the ground water environment were present: eg. Amphipoda, Isopoda, Syncarida, Copepoda, Gastropoda, Turbellaria.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">Before the January 2005 Lower Eyre Peninsula bushfire, surveys conducted as part of the draft Recovery Plan (Pickett 2004) recorded Eyre Peninsula Southern Emu Wrens from 50 sites across lower Eyre Peninsula with five important populations occurring at Marble Range, Kellidie Bay Conservation Park, MacLaren Point-Point Haselgrove, Whalers Way and West Point. A reliable estimate of Eyre Peninsula Southern Emu Wren population size is unavailable, however it is thought that pairs number less than 100 at each of these five important sites. In August 2005, sites where Eyre Peninsula Southern Emu Wrens had been previously recorded in the fireground were revisited. It is believed that an isolated population at Charlton Gully in the Koppio Hills has been lost, however birds were recorded on the edge of the fireground near Murrunatta Conservation Reserve and Ducklake Road (Pickett 2005a). Suitable habitat remnants within the fireground were also re-surveyed to identify priority areas for protection and increasing habitat links (Pickett 2005b). Monitoring to assess success of recovery actions and weed control at revegetation sites are planned throughout 2006/7 as part of the scientific program of the Lower Eyre Peninsula Bushfire Re-establishment Program.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="label"></div>

</div>

<div class="content">The projects seeks to develop a means of accurately determining the population of Southern Bent-winged Bats Miniopterus bassanii in Bat Cave at Naracoorte Caves National Park.  The bat population in Bat Cave was estimated to be 100-200,000 by Dwyer and Hamilton-Smith in 1965. Various estimates between then and the next realistic count in 2000 placed (erroneously) the population at between 200,000 and 400,000 with one park brochure even suggesting three quarters of a million bats present. The population has been determined by a number of methods in the past including mark-recapture, estimating pup density and adult densities on cave walls and video recording the exit fly out. Survey started in 2000 and is ongoing.  The project will build on work by Terry Reardon and Chris Grant, who undertook video counts from 2001 to 2006. A similar methodology will be used. A second component will be working with Adelaide-based company Lastek, to develop an automated bat counting system. This involves placing a thin beam of light across the cave entrance and recording each bat's exit by means of light sensitive diodes linked to a computer. The objective is to develop a permanent system that will count the bats in and out of the cave every day of the year. Preliminary trials have shown the system has no disturbance to the bats.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="label"></div>

</div>

<div class="content">The aim of this project was to develop a system to monitor Heritage Agreements in the Agricultural Region of South Australia as no monitoring was being done at the time (2000). This would provide baseline information on Heritage Agreements in sufficient detail to determine if conditions have improved within them. Assessments occurred for 35 out of 1200 HA.  Data was collected both qualitatively and quantitatively, once from each Heritage Agreement surveyed QUANTITATIVE Survey sites included one or more of the following methods:  - line transects of 50 or 100 metres, with a pole every metre. Species touching the pole are recorded.  - cover quadrats 100m x 4m wide, divided into 10 x 2 metre segments - all the perrenial species were counted.  - Jessup quadrats.   The method was selected depending on the vegetation structure.  QUALITATIVE - the vegetation associations were recorded and mapped using Microsoft Powerpoint - Heritage Agreements were classified into condition classes. - Threats were graded 1-5, (eg. More threatening weeds such as Bridal Creeper would increase the threat grade). - Plant species list produced. - Rare or threatened species noted (however not targeted). - photographs were taken from specific marrked points and included in the report, but they were not actual "photopoints". Someone could go back and take the same photograph.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="label"></div>

</div>

<div class="content">Surveys began in 2000 to assess Bush Stone-curlew (BSc) numbers in areas around southern Eyre Peninsula. These surveys are used to assess the success of predator control programs in Lincoln and Coffin Bay National Parks, using the BSc as an indicator species, focussing on changes in distribution and abundance of the population. Although a population estimate is unavailable, numbers of individuals detected have risen since surveying began, indicating that the baiting program may be positively influencing curlew numbers.  Surveys are conducted using call-playback to incite a response from any individuals in the area. A spotlight is used to aid identification. Surveys are conducted quarterly (spring, summer autumn &amp; winter) in Lincoln NP: Seven sites at Memory Cove and six sites in the Donnington region including Cape Donnington Lighthouse, Donnington Cottage, Engine Point, Stamford Hill, Surfleet Road and Surfleet Campground, as well as annually at Coffin Bay, Port Lincoln township and the Sleaford farming area.  The last survey was conducted in October 2005 and five calls (suspected three individuals) were detected from three sites in the Donnington area (Stamford Hill, Surfleet Road and Campground) and one in the Memory Cove Wilderness Area near West Point. An opportunistic observation in November 2005 has added to distributional data: three individuals were seen near the Myoporum Flat Camping Area in Lincoln National Park.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="label"></div>

</div>

<div class="content">Baseline surveys for the Brown Toadlet, Pseudophryne bibronii, commenced on the 13th May 2009 and concluded on 2 July 2009. Surveys were primarily conducted by two people (one experienced herpetologist, and one volunteer or DEH staff member) although additional observers were sometimes also present. Surveys were focussed in parks in the central Mount Lofty Ranges. Within each park, sections of drainage lines and dams that were easily accessible from vehicles tracks (i.e. within short walking distance) were surveyed. Particular attention was paid to surveying areas within close proximity to existing records.  At each survey site the survey personnel listened for calling male Pseudophryne for a short period of time (1-2 minutes). If no calls were heard, or if calls were heard but verification was required, survey personnel imitated a Pseudophryne call or used recorded call playback (using an ipod and portable speakers) to try and elicit a response from resident male toadlets. After a short period of listening for responses, survey personnel then left the site, or if the habitat appeared suitable, continued searching further along the drainage line. On some occasions, calling individuals were precisely located by removing the surface soil and leaf litter covering them. Efforts were made to undertake surveys soon after periods of rain when possible. Surveys were not undertaken during unsuitable weather conditions i.e. during heavy rain and/or strong wind.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">This project fulfils a component of the project Threatened Fauna Recovery on Eyre Peninsula, funded by the Australian Government's Natural Heritage Trust through the Eyre Peninsula Natural Resources Management Board's 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 investment strategies. The project aimed to review and update Red-lored Whistler records from Eyre Peninsula. Red-lored Whistlers (Pachycephala rufogularis) are listed as Nationally Vulnerable and are recognised as Endangered in South Australia. Their presence has been recorded at only one site in Pinkawillinie Conservation Park on Eyre Peninsula between 1993 and 1995. These records provided a significant western range extension to the species' previously known distribution in Australia.  Despite additional searches in potential habitat on central and northern Eyre Peninsula during the mid-1990s, no other individuals were detected. Call play back surveys undertaken in 2005 and 2006 at 29 sites throughout Pinkawillinie Conservation Park, two sites in Kulliparu Conservation Park and one site on private land failed to detect Red-lored Whistlers. Despite this, it should not be assumed that the species no longer exists in these areas. The Red-lored Whistler can be an elusive bird to observe in the field, especially if it is persisting in small numbers with a restricted distribution, as is expected on Eyre Peninsula.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">BEST is a community group established in the Mid North of South Australia to assist with on-ground works for threatened species conservation and protection. One of the major projects for the Biodiversity and Endangered Species Team (BEST), a Friend of Parks Inc group, is monitoring declining woodland birds in the Mid North, including the Clare Valley, Tothill Ranges, and the Southern Flinders Ranges.  Species targeted include, but are not limited to, the Brown Treecreeper, the State Vulnerable Diamond Firetail, Crested Shrike-tit, Hooded Robin; the Regionally Vulnerable Scarlet Robin and White-winged Chough, and the Grey Currawong, Restless Flycatcher, and Grey Fantail. The Northern &amp; Yorke project centres on the pre-existing Declining Woodland Birds project. Birds Australia are providing a framework for the BEST team to continue the monitoring they have started, and to provide a direction and focus for that work.  Hopefully by continuing to monitor specific sites 4 times a year on an ongoing basis, we can begin to detect trends in bird populations - are some declining, are some increasing, are some shifting in range in response to something (like climate change?)

<div class="content">This survey constitutes part of the Ecological Restoration of Eyre Peninsula program and Ark on Eyre. Monitoring was conducted each spring from 1992 to 1999, although not all traplines were opened during the 1997 and 98 seasons. Pest foxes, cats and rabbits were eradicated by traps, baits and shooting ready for re-introduction of Bettongs. The response of integrated vermin control of rabbits foxes and cats was monitored. The first trial re-introduction of six male Brush-tailed Bettongs into Venus Bay Conservation Park (VBCP) was conducted in April 1994.  The bettongs were radio-collared and tracked over several months to monitor their behaviour and survival.  Following the success of the release, four subsequent releases occurred between September 1994 and January 1995. A total of 61 animals (22 males and 39 females) were released during this time, taking the total number of released individuals to 67. From December 2004 to October 2005 Spotlight surveys along transects were conducted every two-three months to monitor the bettong population.

<div class="content">The aim of this project is to monitor waterfowl bird species at Lake George to assist with management of the area and to determine any relationship between water quality and bird numbers. This includes comparison of water quality, fish and bird numbers. One of the initial outcomes is that birds are poor indicators of water quality as low fish numbers and water quality do not necessarily equate to low bird numbers.The Lake George Management System is due for review and the information gained from this project could contribute to it.   In order to restore and protect the fish habitat and improve overall ecological health of Lake George, in March 2000, a diversion drain was excavated to redirect the freshwater flows from Drain M into the middle and northern large lakes. Following a significant rainfall in the winter and spring of 2000, Lake George has rapidly filled and the mouth has been re-opened to Rivoli Bay. In the end of 2000, SARDI Aquatic Sciences carried out a fish survey and indicated that the abundance of yellow-eye mullet and other main commercial and recreational fish species remained low however the recovery of habitat and productivity has commenced in the lake.  For the implementation of a strategic monitoring program, a project was funded by the Natural Heritage Trust in 2001/02 for the Lake George Management Committee to continue monitoring the recovery of fish populations, aquatic vegetation, and the overall health of the lake. The committee has requested SARDI Aquatic Sciences to be the consultant and work in partnership on this project.   The project was carried out through two fish surveys in August 2001 and March 2002, a survey of the benthic aquatic algae (genus Chara) in March 2002, water quality tests in conjunction with the sampling program, seasonal bird counts, and ongoing monitoring of the water levels and salinity in the lake system.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

Part of a larger project to trial a process (Willoughby 2006) where information and planning at relevant scales will be used to suggest appropriate on-ground works. Approximately 165-200 sites will be surveyed.   Survey Area, 3 trial landscapes- initially suggested as: - Billiatt/Wanbi - variegated; - Mantung/Maggea - fragmented; and - Paruna/Pata - relictual. These landscapes include the range of landscape categories (McIntyre and Hobbs,2000): - Intact - &lt; 10 % destroyed and/or low levels of modification; - Variegated - 10-40 % destroyed and/or low-high modification; - Fragmented - 40-90 % destroyed and/or low-high levels of modification - Relictual - &gt; 90 % destroyed and/or mostly highly modified.  Site Selection: Sites will be stratified against variables (native veg cover and type (floristics), landscape, soils) that may be used to model biota distn and predictive habitat modelling.   Birds: At least 500 bird counts per 2 ha/20 min/site and 3 counts/site for estimates of detectability.  Plants: Biological Survey of SA standard. Some Murray Mallee (BS16) sites to be revisited. This offers an opportunity toward establishing trends in condition. Also, as site condition information will be collected in conjunction with vegetation information at each site.  Site condition: Landscape function analysis (LFA) will be assessed for all sites (Tongway and Hindley 2004).

Laut et al (1977) have described the Pine Lodge Environmental Association as follows: A sandy plain with low hills and numerous irregular dunes. The vegetation cover is of low, open woodland and open mallee scrub with an understorey of mixed chenopod shrubs and grasses." This association covers most of the Scrubby Peak area of the park to the northwest of the Yardea Road. The park conserves more than 55% of this association, which was not previously included in any reserve. The park has some key fauna habitat areas, including semi-permanent soaks and granite waterholes. The park has rocky gullies and outcrops with local entrapments of water. Low woodland, or mallee vegetation, with a complex understorey of hummock grass (Triodia sp) or chenopod and/or Cratystylis, provides the vegetation complexity necessary for the survival of a rich and diverse fauna assemblage.

<div class="label"></div>

</div>

<div class="content">In May and September of 2003 surveys were undertaken in Billiat Conservation Park to increase understanding of the current status of 5 species of threatened mallee birds. The target species were Red-lored Whistler Pachycephala rufogularis, Mallee Emu-wren Stipiturus mallee, Striated Grasswren Amytornis striatus, Mallee Whipbird Psophodes leucogaster leucogaster and Malleefowl Leipoa ocellata. The aim is to understand the distribution and abundance of these birds and to secure local populations of threatened mallee birds in Billiatt Conservation Park, particularly through effective management of wildfire.  A large proportion of the eastern section of Billiatt was searched for these species with 216.5km of broad search transects and 62.5 km of strip transects surveyed. These surveys provided a good insight into the distribution and abundance of these birds in this part of the park with a total of 198 observations recorded. In conclusion Billiatt is extremely important, and this survey indicates that it may support the highest density of Red-lored Whistlers, and possibly also Striated Grasswrens, in the SA Murray-Mallee. Fortunately the sub-populations of these two species appear to be secure. The status of Mallee Emu-wrens and Mallee Whipbirds is not so good, and whilst additional surveys are required, the viability of both species is currently questionable. This work also highlights the fact that the relatively large size of habitat patches like Billiatt can provide us with a false sense of security for the fauna populations that occur there. This habitat is still isolated, and exchange of individuals to and from outside the patch is highly improbable for species such as Emu-wrens or Whipbirds. Given the apparent effect of one large fire on these species, their long-term survival within the park will require active management of the habitat at least.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="label"></div>

</div>

<div class="content">Black Hill Conservation Park contains vegetation associations of excellent quality (indicative of pre-European Mount Lofty Ranges vegetation) and of degraded and modified land. Land clearance, logging, development of market gardens, orchards, grazing, quarrying and residential development resulted in widespread pest plant invasion and loss of species diversity within the Mount Lofty Ranges. The Vegetation Management Plan for Black Hill Conservation Park (Paul 2001) identifies 309 native species, 79 of which have rated conservation significance. The plan also identifies 81 pest plant species. Units 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the Torrens Gorge area of the Park, are identified as areas of relatively high priority due to the presence of species and vegetation associations of rated conservation significance, their uniqueness and integrity and the threats to plant species and associations. The Vegetation Management Plan for Black Hill Conservation Park indicates management units 1, 2 and 3 have an association of Allocasuarina verticillata over Trymalium wayae and Melaleuca lanceolata. This is the only occurrence of its type in the Mount Lofty Ranges. An association of Eucalyptus porosa, Eucalyptus leucoxylon, Eucalyptus camaldulensis woodland over native and exotic grasses and herbs is in the Torrens Gorge area, near the Main Ridge Track. Despite past pressures of grazing and clearing with invasion of exotic grasses and woody weeds, native understorey species survive in patches throughout the community. According to Neagle (1992) Eucalyptus porosa woodlands have a high conservation status (priority 5 poorly conserved or not conserved interstate or only in South Australia). Significant plant species include Logania saxitilis, Phyllanthus saxosus, Cymbopogon ambiguus and Cymbopogon obtectus. In terms of understorey species, Unit 1 has 10 species of rated conservation significance, Unit 2 contains 13 species of rated conservation significance and Unit 3 contains 6 species of rated conservation significance.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">The Scoping The Shoreline 2006 - 2009 survey focussed on monitoring the impact of coastal activities on Eyre Peninsula resident shorebirds. The aims:  -to identify the impact of threats facing resident shorebird populations on Eyre Peninsula -to use the information collected to guide planning and coastal management  The objectives  -to assess the level of threat facing resident shorebirds on Eyre Peninsula -to record the presence and abundance of resident shorebirds  -to survey and map Hooded Plover breeding territories  -to identify potential sites for monitoring Hooded Plover breeding pairs  Target species: all resident shorebirds using Eyre Peninsula's sandy ocean beaches and sheltered embayments; Pied Oystercatcher, Sooty Oystercatcher, Red-capped Plover, Hooded Plover, Masked Lapwing, Banded Lapwing, Banded Stilt and Black-winged Stilt. The project consisted of 51 sampling sites across the Eyre Peninsula coastline and 6 coastal communities; Streaky Bay, Elliston, Coffin Bay, Port Lincoln, Tumby Bay and Thistle Island. Involved long-time local bird-watchers, Friends of Parks groups and Southern Eyre Birds members.The project encourages local communities to take responsibility for monitoring and managing the impacts of increased human activity on their own beaches.  Sites were selected from beach-nesting shorebird records that span at least three decades. Sites include the high energy sandy beaches of Western and Southern Eyre Peninsula and the low energy small bays of Eastern Eyre Peninsula. Other variables influencing site selection include protected/unprotected areas, baited/unbaited hinterland, distance from access points and/or settlement. Survey sites are 1 km transects.

<div class="content">Over the last 30 years counts of migratory and resident shorebirds have been conducted on Eyre Peninsula. These counts have highlighted the importance of the region for shorebirds, identifying several areas that support internationally significant numbers of shorebirds. Some sites have not been counted since 1983 or 2000. Other site data span 28 years. The national project, which is managed by Birds Australia in collaboration with WWF-Australia has been established in response to a growing concern over declining shorebird populations in Australia and the need to reliably determine population trends for species. Shorebirds are considered good indicators of wetland health and therefore provide a useful tool to assess the condition of wetlands. 14 key Shorebird Areas involving 36 specific Count Areas, which are part of a National Shorebird Network of 150 sites, are surveyed at least twice a year; summer &amp; winter. Some sites which have been surveyed since 1979 are also counted in autumn and spring. Each Shorebird Area has been selected using criteria designated by the Birds Australia Shorebirds 2020 Project Team. Objectives: 1.Monitor the population status of migratory and resident shorebirds at 14 Shorebird Areas across on Eyre Peninsula 2.Regularly monitor assess the suitability of shorebird habitats at these sites 3. Assess the relative importance of these sites to the migratory and resident shorebird populations on Eyre Peninsula. The Eyre Peninsula 2020 project extends around 1800km of coastline and encompasses representative areas of low energy embayments with extensive intertidal sandflats, mangrove woodland with intertidal creeks and saltmarshes, high energy sandy ocean beaches backed by dunefields and saline lake systems and rocky reefs and headlands.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">The Tothill Ranges, is a low range (up to 650m above SL) running 15km south-north, north-east of Marrabel. It contains the largest area of remnant vegetation in the Northern &amp; Yorke NRM Board region that is outside the DEH reserve system. Part of the Northern Mount Lofty Ranges, both the size and position of this remnant sitting in 'a sea' of cleared land ensures the conservation of this area is paramount in the protection of biodiversity of this region. The Tothill Ranges sit on the eastern edge of the Northern Agricultural area, the western edge of the Murray Darling Basin near Hopkins Creek Conservation Park and is less than 80 km south east of the Southern Flinders. It has been listed as both the largest remnant and key area in managing salinity in the Upper River Light Catchment (Upper Light River Salinity Management Plan 2003). The Nature Conservation Society South Australia will be conducting flora and fauna surveys, using standard Biological Survey of SA methodology over 10 days (Sep-Oct 2008), at 16 sites in privately owned land being managed for conservation. This includes setting pitfall traps and Elliott Traps for animals, (All trapping methods are undertaken based on Guidelines for Vertebrate Surveys in South Australia using the Biological Survey of South Australia Methodology (Owens, H.M. 2000).

The western area extends from south of Yalata Road house covering the Russell 1:50 000 mapsheet (eastern half of Wahgunyah Conservation Park through to Koonibba and Charra Map sheets (approx 15km east of Ceduna). The survey extends from the coast line to approximately 20 km north of the Eyre Highway and partly adjoins the southern boundaries of Yellabinna and Yumbarra Conservation Parks. The eastern area is contiguous with the western area and extends south east through to the western limits of the Gawler Ranges (Ilkina and Toondulya mapsheets). The northern extent incudes Pureeba and part of Yumbarra Conservation Parks and the southern boundary is approximately 20km south of Smoky Bay and 30km north of Poochera. Coastal sites were largely avoided as the coastline has been previously surveyed. The main aim of this survey was to collect data on the vegetation communities of the Far Western Eyre Peninsula region to enable the classification &amp; mapping on the floristic composition and structure of the vegetation groups of the area. Vegetation was documented with a complete list of plant species within a 50 x 50m quadrat using Braun-Blanquet cover abundance scores. Vertebrate presence was also noted.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

In addition a further 9 quadrats established on the Gawler Ranges National Park in 1985 and 2001 were re-located and the standard photopoints were re-taken.  The project also engaged members of the Gawler Ranges Native Title Group (including 10 elders/youth, 2 Working on Country rangers and the Project Coordinator), western scientists (3-4 experts) and South. Australian Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and SANTS technical/support staff. They worked together to record ecological and cultural data and the value and uses of the plants and animals in the Gawler Ranges National Park. Indigenous participants were trained in biological survey techniques and the shareing and recording of cultural knowledge of plants and animals.  The survey targeted 3-4 separate ecosystems and was undertaken from 27 September/3 October 2010 and involved a field team of some 20 people.

<div class="label"></div>

</div>

<div class="content">This survey number has been established to store bird monitoring data associated with a prescribed burn that was undertaken in Kangaroo Gully, Scott Creek Conservation Park, on 24 April 2007. The focus of the surveys was to monitor the effect of the burn on resident Chestnut-rumped Heathwrens, Hylacola pyrrhopygia parkeri, a nationally endangered taxa. However data on other birds was also collected. Survey methods were as follows: Two mist-netting sessions were undertaken before the burn (one on 7-8 April 2007, the other on 24 April 2007). The intention was to use sightings of these birds pre- and post-fire to follow the fate of individuals and to determine changes in home-ranges of individual birds post fire.The prescribed burn area was systematically and repeatedly surveyed on foot for 11 days before and 15 days immediately after the burn, in autumn 2007. The area was subsequently surveyed for 20 days each at circa six months (spring 2007) and one year (autumn 2008) after the burn, and for six days at two years after the burn (winter 2009). The whole area was covered in a single survey. All the birds seen or heard only in the area were recorded. Call playback was used to assist with detecting Chestnut-rumped Heathwrens during surveys. Playback was usually undertaken in habitat suitable for Chestnut-rumped Heathwrens. Most of the observations were conducted under favourable conditions, on days of calm weather. Continuous observations of how the birds use waterholes (dams) in Kangaroo Gully were also undertaken, before and after the burn. Generally the observation bouts were of one hour each. Dragos Moise was the primary observer but a number of other observers were involved throughout the monitoring, particularly during bird banding.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">This vegetation survey was created for the more rigorous identification of plant species at Landscape Recovery Monitoring Sites on the Gawler Ranges National Park. The monitoring contributes to evaluation of landscape rehabilitation efforts conducted under Operation Bounceback and is tied to an integrated (large) herbivore management plan for the park.  In 1999 Paney Station was acquired to become the Gawler Ranges National Park in 2001, with the Scrubby Peak block added the following year. Stock were removed in 2000, while the portion of Scrubby Peak added to the Park, was generally not stocked, except the area around Scrubby Valley Well. Both Paney and Scrubby Peak were Pastoral Leases, which in 1992 were subject to Pastoral Lease Assessment, involving among other things, the installation of Photopoints to monitor vegetation trends under grazing. New Photopoints were installed on Scrubby Peak, but Paney had an existing system of Photopoints established mostly in 1987, to which some new sites were added in 1992.  Paney Station has a very long history of stocking (mainly sheep) and its valleys and plains were substantially degraded as a result, but rocky hills, generally avoided by stock, are in much better condition. Hills are frequently affected by fires and since the 1970's had suffered from feral goat browse pressure, which has been kept at low intensity with effective goat gontrols being maintained since 2001. With stock removal, and control of kangaroos, rabbits and feral goats, the landscape is expected to recover and the existing Photopoints, supplemented with some Biological Survey sites (from 1985), were converted to a recovery and herbivore management monitoring framework. This conversion is gradual, involving the formulation of ecological recovery objectives and physical transformation of Photopoint sites to better analyse data which inform on progress toward objectives.  Prior to 2009, plant identification was done by the observers on field trips. A succession of observers over the first series of monitoring visits applied various names to what was certainly a single species, so a more rigorous identification procedure is now employed. Thoroughness of their plant sampling was likely also variable. Vouchering survey akin to that used in Flora Surveys of the Biological Survey was undertaken in 2009, to provide substantiated record as reference for future visits and possibly for better definition of floristic communities associated with recovery states.Procedures for accessing data within the Biological Database of South Australia are described at http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Knowledge_Bank/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia .This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Australia License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/au/).Data from Wallaby Creek flux tower, Victoria. <br /><br />
The Wallaby Creek flux station is located in Kinglake National Park, Victoria, South Eastern Australia: 37Âº 25â€™ 34.4"S, 145Âº 11â€™ 14.1"E. The area is assigned the IUCN Category II (National Parks) of the United Nationsâ€™ list of National Parks and protected areas, which means that park is primarily managed for ecosystem conservation.<br /><br />
The site is approximately 45km north east of Melbourne, lies at an elevation of approximately 720 metres, and is located on the southern edge of the Hume Plateau. The catchment area is dominated by Eucalyptus Regnans or Mountain Ash, the worldâ€™s tallest flowering plant (angiosperm). Trees can reach heights of more than 90 metres growing in areas with high rainfall and fertile soil. These trees are well distributed throughout Victoriaâ€™s Central Highlands including the Otway Ranges and Strzlecki Ranges; they are also found in Tasmania. The site contains a chronosequence of (20, 80 and 300) stand ages that were established during fires occurring over the last 300 years.<br /><br />
The tower itself is located within an old growth stand with individual trees as old as 300 years. Mountain ash forests are confined to the cool mountain regions with elevations ranging from 460 - 1100m and average rainfalls of 1100-2000mm. The catchment area contains a portion of the Mt Disappointment range, the Divide and the headwaters of Wallaby Creek and Silver Creek, and much of the slopes are characterised as flat to moderate.<br /><br />
The major soil type within the forest is krasnozemic soils, which are friable red/brown, with high amounts of organic matter in the upper 20 â€“ 30cm. However, the composition of krasnozemic soils is not homogenous, but rather a variation with altitude can be observed; lower altitudes inhabit grey-yellow podsolised soils compared to higher altitudes of the Kinglake and Hume plateau where the soil composition is krasnozemic loams. The clay content of these soils increases with depth until at least 200 cm deep, where after a transition soils contain rock fragments.<br /><br />
Bushfires swept through the region in January 2009 destroying the tower. Data from the site has been recorded from May 2010 onwards. As the tower is relatively new, the post fire instrumentation is currently not as diverse when compared to the pre fire instrumentation.     <br /><br />
The climate of the study area is classified as a cool, temperate zone, with the highest temperatures occurring during the summer months of December â€“ February (13.8 â€“ 22.5Â°C), whilst the coolest temperatures are experienced in May and August (4.7 â€“ 9.2Â°C). Average annual precipitation is 1209mm, with a maximum rainfall occurring in June (Ashton, 2000). The study site experiences foggy conditions after sunset during autumn and winter.<br /><br />
The forest is classed as a tall, wet sclerophyll forest, and the dominant Mountain Ash trees have an average canopy height of 75m. Below the dominant canopy lies a temperate rainforest understorey consisting of Pomaderris aspera and Olearia argophylla species, which are 10-18 metres tall. The lower layers of vegetation are dominated by tree ferns (Cyathea australis and Dicksonia antartica) and extensive tracts of rosette and rhizonic ferns (Polystichum proliferum and Blechnum wattsii) as well as Acacia trees.This work is publicly available</div>

<div class="content">The South Australian Arid Lands (SAAL) Natural Resources Management (NRM) region covers over 50% of the state, including some of the driest parts of South Australia. It has the largest percentage of intact ecosystems and natural biodiversity than any other NRM region in the State. The human population in this semi arid region is small (less than 2% of the State) and geographically dispersed. The region's environmental processes are determined by irregular rainfall and other episodic weather events that rarely follow predictable annual cycles. The most widespread production activity is pastoralism, however large mining and petroleum companies also operate in the Arid Lands. The region contains some of the state's most environmentally significant natural resources including Conservation Reserves, National Parks as well as two great inland water systems: Lake Eyre and the Great Artesian Basin. The Arid Lands Information System (ALIS) is a web-based, spatially enabled data capture, storage, querying and reporting tool which aims to be a single point of access for data and information about the arid areas of South Australia.</div>

<div class="content">The Gawler Bioregion Vegetation Monitoring Prject was undertaken as part of the South Australian Component of the National Land and Water Resources Audit.  The project investigated the future use of approximately 5000 permanent monitoring sites in the Rangelands that are used to report vegetation and biodiversity trends on a bioregion basis.Over 1900 monitoring sites are located within the study area, most of which were established between 1990 and 1993.  These sites were assigned to a vegetation group (n= 15) using the  Pattern Analysis (PATN) statistical method.  A 10% random sample was taken from all sites that had quantitive data stratified across vegetation groups and then by rangeland condition class.  Perennial shrub density and projected foliar cover were remeasured at these sites.This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">A land image-based resource information system (LIBRIS) has been developed to support rangeland resource management on both regional and local scales. The study area is centred on the mining town of Broken Hill which lies within the semi-arid rangelands of southern Australia. LIBRIS is a geographic information system developed to integrate Landsat spectral data with other relevant spatial data sets (tenure, rangeland type, elevation and slope) not only to improve the interpretation of Landsat data for rangeland applications, but also for report generation and the modelling and derivation of other landscape variable such as susceptibility to erosion. A simple vegetation-Landsat response model is used within LIBRIS. The model, based on field reflectance data, has two indices representing the proportions of "cover" and "greenness" (vigour) of the sparse rangeland vegetation.The Land Image-based Resource Information System (LIBRIS) uses Landsat image data for rangeland assessment and monitoring.This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="label"></div>

</div>

<div class="content">The land system mapping project provides an understanding of soils and the landscapes in which they occur.  This project has provided fundamental information for making decisions about land use and land management.The main mapping units are Land Systems. These are broad landscape features within which there are recurring patterns of geology, topography, soils and vegetation. They have local geographic names abbreviated to three letters. Each Land System comprises one or more Soil Landscape Units. These are recognizable topographic features formed on a particular geological material or group of materials. They include a limited and defined range of soil classes. They therefore have similar land qualities and land use potential. The Soil Landscape Units are labelled with three (sometimes four or five) character codes. The first character indicates the geological setting and broad soil grouping. These are summarized in Table 1. The second and third characters describe component soil associations and topographic features respectively. The maps and land descriptions were compiled using 1:40,000 scale aerial photography, existing geology and soil maps, and data collected during field investigations. The field work was designed to provide a general indication of the soils and other features of the various landscapes identified by aerial photograph interpretation. The field assessments included morphological descriptions to depths of between 50 and 200 cm, depending on the nature of the soil, and site descriptions in accordance with the standards set out in the Australian Soil and Land Survey Field Handbook (McDonald et al 1990). Soil profiles were classified according to the Australian Soil Classification (Isbell, 1996). Laboratory determinations of pH and electrical conductivity were made on selected samples form the field survey. More detailed chemical analyses were undertaken on samples from almost 700 representative sites across the state.This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">The aim of this project was to improve the understanding of the benefits (both to primary production and rangeland condition) and costs of controlling pest mammals and kangaroos that could lead to a reassessment of management practices and policy regarding domestic and wild grazing mammals in the rangelands.  This project has focused on, the effects on rangeland condition and livestock production of reducing the numbers of kangaroos, feral goats and rabbits in the sheep-grazed rangelands of South Australia.  This project was conducted in four study areas on portions of five pastoral leases in the North East Pastoral District and involved the cooperation of pastoralists, the local Soil Board and three agencies of the South Australian and Commonwealth Governments.  The study accumulated significant data on the changes that may occur.  The herbivore control program begun with kangaroo shooters operating in two of the study areas and rabbit warrens being ripped in all four.  Plant biomass and floristic composition were measured twice a year, while wool production and lambing percentages were recorded on an annual basis.Rangeland improvement depends on control of grazing of unwanted herbivores.  Whether it is easier or more cost-effective to improve rangeland condition by controlling some herbivores rather than others remains largely unknown, as does the level and duration of control that is needed.  This project was designed to provide more information on the effects of managing herbivores on the growth and regeneration of individual plant species and on the level of the extra livestock production that results.This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="label"></div>

</div>

<div class="content">During the program, about 5500 permanent photopoint sites were established on each of the 218 pastoral properties.  Each property was given a photo manual and a 'paddock plan' which was compiled during this assessment program.  These plans, which were produced in ARC/Info GIS, provided accurate lease infrastructure, together with land systems information and the locations of all waterpoints and photopoint sites.  Methods common to inspections and assessments include: collation of all relevant existing information, field inspection including communication with land managers on issues, stock numbers and changes in improvements, setting up and re-monitoring of photo-points, assessment of paddock condition rating, entry of data and updating of inventory for production of maps, production of a report for consideration of the Pastoral Board.  In addition, an assessment can include use of the "Land Condition Index"  (Lange, R.T, Lay, B.G. and Tynan, R.W. (1994) Evaluation of extensive arid rangelands: the Land Condition Index (LCI). Transactions of the Royal Society of South Australia. 118, 125-131). This method is used to compare land condition from one time to another but also comparatively across a district for each pasture type.This project was established to monitor the change in vegetation types over time and determine the capacity of the land to carry stock.  Under the Pastoral Land Management and Conservation Act 1989 (Act), the assessment of the lands comprising a pastoral lease is required before the tenure of any lease is extended, and for any lease this assessment must be carried out at intervals not exceeding 14 years.  Photopoints were established on 218 Pastoral properties and about 5500 permanent photopoint sites were established.  At each photopoint site, information on plant composition and abundance, grazing or other impacts or disturbance, soil erosion and soil surface cover was collected, together with detail on location of the site, GPS coordinates, etc. as an aid to future re-visits.  At many of the sites the soil profile was also described, together with details of slope, geology etc.This data is subject to conditions described in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) licence.

<div class="content">The aim of the Seedling Survey was to document the diversity and patterns of relative species abundances from a sample of seedlings. For this survey, a seedling was defined as any stem â‰¥ 15 cm in height, and â‰¤ 1 cm diameter at breast height (130 cm), and thus included not only tree seedlings, but also herbs, shrubs and vines. A total of 169 seedling transects (hereafter Lines) was established using the 20 m grid established by CSIRO. Each line is nominally 20 m long (the distance between white plastic posts), and to 1 m wide to the east of the line between the posts. The 169 Lines are arranged in a 13 x 13 m grid. All Lines are oriented south-north, with the start of each Line at the southern end. For a complete listing of Line coordinates, see Robson_20M_Seedling_Line_Coords.txt.</div>

<h3><a href="http://portal-dev.tern.org.au/view/dataview?key=fahmi.32" target="_blank">Capturing soil greenhouse gas emissions and microbial origin</a></h3>

<div class="label"></div>

</div>

<div class="content">In Australia there is an increasing wealth of information on GG emissions from agricultural environments but there is limited research on GG emissions from natural/native forest ecosystems. Most greenhouse gas field studies are undertaken in agricultural systems under N fertilization, representing an expanding source of N2O (Neftel, Flechard et al. 2007). In contrast, tropical rainforest is a significant sink of atmospheric CH4 (Kiese, Hewett et al. 2003), however, there is little information available on subtropical ecosystems. At SERF there is a unique subtropical research setting whereby small-scale ecosystems representing land-use change are present side by side.<br />
Studies on GG emissions and studies on microbial community structure in relation to soil and vegetation parameters are currently mutually exclusive. There is little data on seasonal change in microbial community composition to support chemical flux measurements (Kiese, Hewett et al. 2003; Kulmala, Launiainen et al. 2008). How greatly does the bacterial community composition vary between sites and can it be related to GG emissions? Do intensively farmed soils still have the capacity to regain functional physicochemistry and biology (Bardgett &amp; Shine 1999, Loiseau et al 1995, Balesdent et al 1996)?<br />
The first aim of this scoping study will be to measure soil greenhouse gas emissions from native forest and adjacent land that has been cleared for pasture.<br />
The second aim will be to relate these emissions to microbial community analysis using molecular methods.<br /><br />
Data includes GHG fluxes, rainfall, soil physicochemical parameters: pH, temperature, %VWC, nitrate/ammonia, bulk density, also photos<br />
Also have frozen soil samples, DNA extracted from soils, method/reagents for methanotroph PCR<br />
Also have data for one bench expt which compared GHG fluxes from wetted pasture, forest, tilled, grazed soil cores.</div>
